1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
(Ebola 0.25 0.70 5 0.90 1) Population Size: 5 percent vaccinated = 70 virus namm = ebola mortality rate = 90 reproductive rate= 0.25
2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
20%
3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
20%
4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
100 interactions
